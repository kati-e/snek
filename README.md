#A simple version of the 'snake' game

Just making this small console game for fun because I enjoy C#.
Please feel free to use this code for whatever you like, I don't mind.

The Game Rules:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Snake moves right, left, up & down (A,D,W,S)
2. To gain points you must eat fruits (#)
3. When you eat fruits you gain a body part
4. You die if your body touches itself or the wall
5. Your 'High Score' is saved in history 

The Board Design:

Hope you enjoyed my C# Snek Game.

I tried really hard to make this, and it is a good learning experience so far.
This is the first time I ever created the 'snake' game from scratch though I have made other console games before.
I am still fairly new to C# so please go easy on me (/^ - ^)/ ︵ ┻━┻

Feel free to use my code to learn or to make your own.
(No need to attribute me but ty if you do)

Also if you want to join in coding this with me feel free to contribute.
